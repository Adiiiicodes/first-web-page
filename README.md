**Project Title:** 🎮 The Ultimate Game Hub: STP & Number Guessing! 🎲

**Project Description:**

Welcome to the Ultimate Game Hub, where epic battles of luck and skill await! Ready to test your wits against a computer that totally doesn’t cheat (we promise)? 😜

**Game 1: Stone, Paper, Scissors (STP) ✊✋✌️**
Remember when you used to settle arguments with this game? Well, now you can settle them with a machine! Play a best-of-X series and see who’s the real champ. Spoiler: The computer’s a bit salty when it loses, but don’t worry, it’s all in good fun! Just don’t let it catch you gloating. 😏

**Game 2: Number Guessing Game 🔢**
Think you can guess the number our computer has in mind? It’s like trying to read the mind of a fortune teller, but without the crystal ball. Enter your guess and see if you can crack the code. Too high? Too low? Just right? You’ll get there... eventually. If not, there’s always next time! 😅

Get ready for some serious fun, whether you’re looking to kill time, avoid doing your homework, or just prove that you’re smarter than a computer (hint: you totally are). 😎

**Let the games begin!** 🕹️
